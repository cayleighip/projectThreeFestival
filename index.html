                <p>The Voices for Choice festival is in partnership with the Planned Parenthood Action Fund to raise awareness and funds for the cause. We aim to raise awareness to local communities and inspire change in our local communities. The Voices for Choice is using our platform to promote education, advocate for reproductive rights, and emphasize the importance of social justice and healthcare access for all. We fight for women’s rights and aim to raise awareness and support policies that protect reproductive rights that ensures that every woman has access to the healthcare she needs. Voices for Choice will create a better future for all. </p>
