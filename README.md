# Title 
Social Justice Festival - Voices for Choice

# Project Overview
The "Voices for Choice" festival was created to benefit the Planned Parenthood Action Fund, a cause that advocates for reproductive health services and access to healthcare for women. As a designer, I have the opportunity to use my voice to inspire societal change. Supporting this cause deeply resonates with me because I strongly believe in bodily autonomyâ€”the fundamental human right to make informed decisions about their health. 

After the overturning of Roe V. Wade, it is crucial to support reproductive rights, particularly in states where abortion is now illegal. I believe that everyone should have full control over their bodies and the right to make informed decisions. Through this fictious festival, I aim to raise awareness and support policies that protect reproductive rights that ensures that every woman has access to the healthcare she needs. 

The "Voices for Choice" festival was created to raise awareness to local communities and inspire change. It is a platform that is used to promote education, advocate for reproductive rights, and emphasize the importance of social justice and healthcare access for all.
